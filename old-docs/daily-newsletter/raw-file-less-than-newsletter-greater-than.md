What to Do?

The Newsletter is read by Students preparing for competitive examinations and this Questionnaire is a part of their preparation to assess themselves on the understanding of the newsletter read by them.
- Questionnaire-Level: The students expect the question statements to be challenging enough to test thorough reading of the newsletter. Questions should be precise but not easily answerable without careful study of the content.

    2. Ensure questions cover different topics/sections from the newsletter for comprehensive assessment.
- STRICTLY: Avoid lengthy questions or explanatory answers. Always remember the above mentioned NOTE when framing Question-Answers from the document.
